				<h2>About our child care services</h2>
				<p>For over 10 years, we have been providing child care development with safety and TLC in mind. We specialize in child care for infants and toddlers, so we've made sure that our home is clean, comfortable and safe for your child. We have a non-smoking home, no pets and no swimming pool, and all sleeping areas are personalized for comfort and hygiene. For recreational activities, we have a wonderful, spacious back yard as well as a separate play room.</p>
				<p>All supplies and food are provided, so you don't have to worry about diapers and formula! However, if your child has specialty needs, you will need to bring any required supplies.</p>
				<p>Little Angels day care is based in Plano, Texas, northeast of the Dallas North Tollway and President George Bush Turnpike. We are conveniently located to serve Plano, as well as the nearby communities of Allen, Frisco and Richardson.</p>
				<p>We love child care, and we look forward to caring for your child's individual needs!</p>

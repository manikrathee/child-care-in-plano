				<p class="heading">Our Mission</p>
				<p>For over 15 years, we have been providing childcare for infants and toddlers with safety and nurturing as our top priorities. We are committed to providing your child with a loving and educational environment, lots of support for positive development, and most importantly plenty of love! We aim to give you peace of mind that your unique little angel is being provided the highest quality of individualized care.</p>
				
				<p class="heading">Our Home</p>
				<p>At Little Angels Home Daycare, we specialize in care for infants and toddlers, so we've made sure that our home is clean, comfortable and safe for your child. We use allergy filters, and have monitored fire and burglary alarms. We have a non-smoking home, with no pets and no swimming pool. All sleeping areas are personalized for comfort and hygiene. For recreational activities, we have a wonderful, spacious back yard as well as a separate playroom full of toys that cater to rapidly developing young minds.</p>
				
				<p class="heading">Our Services</p>
				<p>Here, all supplies and food are provided, so you don't have to worry about diapers or formula! If your child has specialty needs, you will need to bring any required supplies and we will be happy to accommodate them. We also strive to create a dynamic play schedule: indoor and outdoor play, story and music time are part of our daily routine. Our goal is to develop your childâ€™s motor and language skills through age-specific activities and exercises.</p>
